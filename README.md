# Music-Database-System
Developed a Music Database System that allows one to login as an artist or a user.
As an artist, one can perform operations such as addition and deletion of records, and also view one's streaming data in the database.
As a user, one can view artist/album/song specific data as well as retrieve a randomly generated playlist.
The stream-counts get updated whenever a user performs a listen operation of a song or an album. The database used for this project was
generated from my personal music streaming data (retrieve from LastFM).
